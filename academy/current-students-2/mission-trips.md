**Fall and Spring Mission Trips**

Mission trips give students a unique opportunity to participate in direct evangelism
  
and see the great controversy between Christ and Satan in action, to experience a
  
different culture, to work as a team, and to themselves grow spiritually while
  
working for the salvation of others. Ouachita Hills Academy believes in missions
  
and want to develop within its students a desire to be life long missionaries
  
wherever the Lord calls them.

It is for these reasons that mission trips are an important part of the academic
  
calendar. The fall mission trip is a combination academy and college student trip
  
which extends over Thanksgiving break. It is generally in some part of South or
  
Central America. The funds needed to participate in the trip currently is
  
$1600. Students from any class can apply to participate. A student must
  
show himself academically able to miss about two weeks of classes and mature
  
enough to participate in the program, to be chosen.

The spring trip is restricted to seniors and is part of the graduation requirement. It
  
is a five week trip which extends over Spring break. It may be any place in the world.
  
The current cost of the trip is $2600.

On these trips students preach evangelistic series, present health talks, or conduct
  
childrenâ€™s meetings. In some countries they may aid in construction projects for the
  
local church, give Bible studies, and conduct Health Expos. Countries where
  
evangelistic meetings have been held include countries such as India, Thailand, the
  
Philippines, Brazil, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Panama, Russia, Ukraine, Serbia, Romania,
  
Haiti, and Bulgaria.

OHA staff will assist students and parents in fund raising, however, funds not raised
  
by donations are the responsibility of parents.
