**About Our Curriculum**

Ouachita Hills Academy offers a college preparatory curriculum with standard high school classes for math, physcial and life sciences, English grammar and composition, and the social sciences. Each year of study includes a required Bible class. All students will receive music education in our general choir program. In addition, we offer foreign languages, computer science, and health classes. In all of our classes we strive for academic excellence in the course content as well as endeavor to make the Bible the foundation.

Our vocational classes are integrated into the curriculum as well.
