"Graduation is a milestone that I have been working to reach for four years. Looking back, I know I've made many mistakes
but have learned to trust God in any situation. I'm graduation with a sense of determination and I can't wait to get my 
diploma in my hands." - OHA Senior

Graduation is coming up toward the end of May. Details about graduation will be posted soon.
