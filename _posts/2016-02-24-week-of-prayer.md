This week has been the first week of prayer of 2016. It started Monday, February 22nd and 
will continue through Friday. You can watch it live online on our live stream.

This week has been dedicated to the 10 commandments. Everyone has heard of the Ten Commandments 
but few can recite them all. This week is a journey through the meaning of the commandments 
and the promises that are within them.

This week of prayer is hosted by our very own college students. There are morning and evening 
meetings. The morning meetings start at 7:45 a.m. and the evening meetings start at 6:45 p.m. 
The prayer emphasis has reminded us of the power of prayer and what prayer means to the true 
Christian.
