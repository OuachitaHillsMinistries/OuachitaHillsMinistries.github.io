Construction is an ever on-going process at Ouachita Hills! One of our most current projects is a place to hold home-style wellness
programs located on school property about half a mile from the main campus Currently students are gaining construction skills by 
assisting in the areas of electrical, bricklaying, insulation, and hanging drywall.
