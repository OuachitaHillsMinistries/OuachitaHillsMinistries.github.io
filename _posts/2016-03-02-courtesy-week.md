Courtesy. What is it? Is it just adhering to a list of etiquette rules? February 28-March 
4 Ouachita Hills morning and evening worships and Assembly are focusing on what is true 
courtesy. We have been reminded: “Hearts that are filled with the love of Christ can never 
get very far apart. Religion is love, and a Christian home is one where love reigns and 
finds expression in words and acts of thoughtful kindness and gentle courtesy.” {AH 94.2}

We’ve had fun, too, in being reminded of the rules of etiquette in a variety of creative 
ways.
