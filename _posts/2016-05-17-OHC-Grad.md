Ouachita Hills College is proud to congratulate our 2016 graduating class! This
year we graduated twelve students, representing the fields of Education, Business,
Theology and Personal Ministry. We may not know what the future holds for each of
these graduates, but we are confident that God will guide them as they continue to
seek Him daily.

*And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.*
*Colossians 3:23*
