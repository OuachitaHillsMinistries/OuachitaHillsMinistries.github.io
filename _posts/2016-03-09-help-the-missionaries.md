The seniors have already left on their mission trip but there was work to be done beforehand. “Help the Missionaries,” 
a favorite Saturday night activity for many, is a fun time during which students help prepare crafts for the Children’s 
program. Students and staff can visit while keeping their hands busy cutting out and preparing materials for the trip.  
We all come away knowing we have had a little part in reaching the children of the world for Jesus.
