The Grand Finale of Courtesy Week is the Courtesy Banquet. This yearâ€™s theme took us 
south of the boarder and the tamales and other delicacies made by the Foods Class were 
enjoyed by all! The young ladies and the young men arrived in their Sabbath best, 
ready to apply what they had learned during Courtesy Week. Dorm Open Houses followed 
with academy and college students getting to show their rooms to the rest of the students 
on campus.
