**At Ouachita Hills College, we know that true education means so much more than just 
having strong academic programs.**

**Spiritual Life**
  
Every student will find opportunities to cultivate the essential daily habits of a 
meaningful relationship with God. We encourage individual study of Scripture and a 
thoughtful prayer life. We also begin and end each day with worship and Bible study 
together.

**Serving Others**
  
Serving the individuals and communities around us is a natural extension of spiritual life. 
Every Sabbath, students go out in teams to serve at a church in a nearby community. On 
Sabbath afternoons, these teams may visit the elderly, study the Bible with individuals or 
families, or conduct surveys to find out about community needs. Each semester, students 
and staff take a break from classes to work together for one day to tackle specific 
challenges in local communities.

**Fresh Food**
  
We are committed to serving fresh, healthy meals designed to promote students&#8217; 
physical well-being and mental clarity. Many of the vegetables and fruits we serve every 
day come from our own garden and greenhouses. Our meals are 100% vegan, and we offer 
gluten-free options at every meal.

**Places to Explore**
  
Our campus is just a short drive from many of Arkansas&#8217; beautiful natural areas and 
state parks. OHC students like to spend their free time hiking, biking, kayaking, canoeing 
and swimming in and around the Ouachita National Forest.

**Working Together**
  
Every student has a campus job in one of five main areas &#8211; Agriculture, Media, 
Construction, Office Assisting, or Food Service. All of our students learn practical 
skills and work ethic while helping to offset the cost of tuition and other expenses. 
In addition, many students choose to work in our [canvassing programs](http://localhost:8080/wordpress/canvassing/), 
which can lower the cost of their education significantly.
