### Fall Mission Trip

Our Fall Mission trip give students a unique opportunity to participate in direct evangelism
  
and see the great controversy between Christ and Satan in action, to experience a
  
different culture, to work as a team, and to grow spiritually while
  
working for the salvation of others. Ouachita Hills Academy believes in missions
  
and want to develop within its students a desire to be life long missionaries
  
wherever the Lord calls them.

The fall mission trip is a combination college and academy student trip
  
which extends over Thanksgiving break. It is generally in some part of South or
  
Central America. The individual funding needed to participate in this trip is approximately
  
$1600.  A student must demonstrate academic ability to miss about two weeks of classes and 

maturity to participate in the program in order to be selected for the program.

On these trips students preach in evangelistic series, present health talks, and conduct
  
childrenâ€™s meetings. In some countries they may aid in construction projects for the
  
local church, give Bible studies, and conduct Health Expos. 

Students are responsible for fundraising, and may consider working with their families and
 
home church congregations.

### Student-organized Mission Trips

Some OHC students may plan and organize mission trips during Spring Break. Students are 

welcome to participate in these mission trips, and are responsible for fundraising.
