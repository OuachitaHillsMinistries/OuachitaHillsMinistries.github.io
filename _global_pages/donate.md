Thank you for your continual support to Ouachita Hills College. Your generous contributions allow us to continue to provide
an affordable Christian education, practical vocational training and inspiring outreach opportunities for our students.

Although you can support our school in other areas, here are some immediate needs for our college has:

Win, win, win project:  
	
	At Ouachita Hills College, students have the opportunity to fulfill the Gospel commission, while they earn money to pay for their tuition that will in turn support OHC operations and during this process they strengthen their relationship with God and develop a character that stand firm in the mids of rejection.  What a great blessing is this program to the students and to humanity!  The students, the school, and the community in general are all benefited by the outcome of this effort.  Only in heaven we will be able to see the impact that the 500,000 books that have been distributed during the last 5 years by students had in humanity. 

	To make this program a reality, OHC provides minivans that are strictly used for literature distribution.  Our canvassing vans get not less than 30,000 miles per year and we are in constant need to replace minivans that have around 200,000 miles in it for safety issues.
	
	Today we are in need of two minivans and 1 five-passengers vehicle that will be used to distribute literature with the message of Truth during the next 2-3 years.

  We would like to raise $15,000 for this project or if you are willing to donate a minivan or a vehicle with low millage for this program, please give us a call.

  Thank you for partnering with us in this project!
