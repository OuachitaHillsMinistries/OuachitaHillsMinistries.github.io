Ouachita Hills Academy is a private boarding school for students in grades 9 through 12. 
We offer a rigorous academic curriculum combined with focused vocational training and music 
education for all students. Our students&#8217; spiritual growth is our first priority, and 
every student will find many opportunities to worship, study the Bible, pray and serve.
