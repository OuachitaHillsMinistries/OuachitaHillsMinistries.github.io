#### Join a canvassing team and reach communities for Christ!

Canvassing is a door-to-door ministry that gives students the opportunity to share Christian 
literature focused on personal growth, health and the family while raising funds for tuition and 
scholarship programs. Students travel in teams to communities around the country twice during 
the fall semester and twice during the spring semester. There is also an optional ten-week 
summer program.

Our canvassers can expect a spiritual emphasis that is focused on fulfilling 
Christ's mission. Our goal is that each canvasser may grow in their relationship 
with God and with others.

Our canvassing programs offer students a way to share the Gospel and support our college. 
A percentage of all donations received by these programs directly supports our college. 
Student participation in canvassing helps us to keep tuition and costs low so that our 
students graduate with little or no debt.

If you would like to join a team of OHC students in one of our upcoming canvassing programs,
