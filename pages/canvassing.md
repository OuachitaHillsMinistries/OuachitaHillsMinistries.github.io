Canvassing is a door-to-door ministry that connects students and individuals Students 
travel in teams to communities around the country twice during the fall semester and 
twice during the spring semester. There is also an optional ten-week summer program.

Our canvassers can expect a spiritual emphasis that is focused on fulfilling 
Christ&#8217;s mission. Our goal is that each canvasser may grow in their relationship 
with God and with others.

Our canvassing programs offer students a way to share the Gospel and support our college. 
A percentage of all donations received by these programs directly supports our college. 
Student participation in canvassing helps us to keep tuition and costs low so that our 
students graduate with little or no debt.
