**Due to the fact that GPS directions have at times taken people on logging roads through rough
terrain, we suggest that you follow directions to the city of Amity and follow these directions 
from there:**

1) If coming to Amity from the east, go 1 block west of the fountain on Hwy 8 (Also Hwy 84) toward 
Glenwood, AR to South Mountain Road. If you are coming from the west you would turn right on 
Mountain Road which is one block before the fountain in the city circle. (There is an old, out-of-business 
gas station on the corner called Carlie’s Corner.)

2)  Continue on South Mountain Road approximately 3.8 miles.  

3) Turn on the first road (not drive way after the bridge) on the right which is Harley.  The road somewhat 
Ys there and a Ouachita Hills sign is on the left in the Y  with an arrow pointing to the right at this juncture.

4) In about ¼ mile you will see the main Ouachita Hills sign in front of you.  Go to the left of the sign to 
enter campus. 

5 At the first “Y” at the bottom of the hill continue to go straight if you are going to the administration 
building or turn left and follow the road around campus to the parking lot behind the two story metal grey 
building if you are going to the cafeteria.
