Ouachita Hills College is a self-supporting school located in southwestern Arkansas.  Our practical approach to true education equips students to work and serve wherever God may call them to go, and ensures that students graduate with low or no debt. We strive to provide a spiritual environment that encourages a closer walk with Christ. Every student at Ouachita Hills will find opportunities for serving their peers, churches and communities, both locally and abroad.
