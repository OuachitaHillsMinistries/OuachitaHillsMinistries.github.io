**Our Vocational Work Education Programs**  
Ouachita Hills Academy seeks to develop well-rounded students with strong life skills. 
Each of our students participates in a vocational work education program that combines 
practical experience with theoretical training in a classroom setting. Students may be 
assigned to one or more of the vocational areas.

**Agriculture**  
Most incoming young men are assigned to Agriculture. This work area especially helps 
students to develop good work ethic and discipline, and to learn the value of individual 
responsibility.

Students learn how to faithfully cultivate soil, especially for gardens and orchards. They 
learn about the different and unique requirements of specific plants, and how to harvest 
and process. Students also learn how to save seed and propagate trees and plants.

**Automotive**  
Automotive is great opportunity to dive into the anatomy of motor vehicles. What the 
students work on depends on the needs of that particular year, but students have the 
potential to work on a variety of projects. Students learn to replace parts such as water 
pumps, thermostats, alternators, exhaust manifolds, brakes, tires, and much more. They 
also learn how to use tire changers and balancers, how to clean parts, and how to use 
specialized equipment. They learn how to diagnose problems and use problem solving skills 
in order to determine a cost effective method to repair a vehicle.

**Construction**  
Students in construction learn basic skills in a variety of trades, which may include 
carpentry, electrical, plumbing, remodeling, and repair. The focus of construction is 
developing work ethic and character. Students will learn to use critical thinking and 
problem solving skills.

**Food Service**  
Students have the opportunity to learn how to work in a fast-paced food service 
environment. Most incoming young women are assigned to food service. Students learn to 
use and modify recipes and how to operate basic kitchen appliances. They also learn 
methods for storing, preserving and cooking food. Kitchen safety and sanitation are 
emphasized as well.

**Office**  
In the office, students are paired with a teacher or staff member as an office assistant. 
They may prepare documents, grade assignments, update databases or write website content.

Some students may also work with Ouachita Hills Resources in customer service. Students 
learn do order processing, printing, binding, and material duplication for orders. They 
may also help with bookkeeping, accounting, and filing.

**Housekeeping**  
Students working in housekeeping learn to manage the cleaning schedule for our main 
buildings on campus. This vocational area teaches students to work efficiently and to 
manage their time well. 

**Information Technology**  
One or two students may be paired with the Information Technology department to assist 
with technical support for the computer lab and for school-issued student laptops.
