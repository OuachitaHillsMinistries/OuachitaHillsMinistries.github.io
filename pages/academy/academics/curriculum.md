Ouachita Hills Academy offers a college preparatory curriculum with standard high school
classes for math, physcial and life sciences, English grammar and composition, and the
social sciences. Each year of study includes a required Bible class. All students will
receive music education in our general choir program. In addition, we offer foreign
languages, computer science, and health classes. In all of our classes we strive for
academic excellence in the course content as well as endeavor to make the Bible the
foundation.

Our vocational classes are integrated into the curriculum as well. Each semester students
will study in one of several areas areas &#8211; Agriculture, Construction, Food
