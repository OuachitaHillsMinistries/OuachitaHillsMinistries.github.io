**How can I make a phone call to my academy student(s)?**
  
Students may receive or place phone calls on the phones located in the dorms. These phones 
cannot make long distance calls. Any long distance call made by a student must be placed 
using a calling card. The best time to talk with your student is in the evening when 
students are generally in the dorms. Please be aware that students will not be allowed to 
make or receive calls during evening worship and study hall hours from 6:45 to 8:45 p.m., 
or after &#8220;lights out&#8221; at 9:30 p.m. 

Girls&#8217; Dorm Number (870) 342 5175
  
Boys&#8217; Dorm Number (870) 342 9580

**How can I mail a letter, card or package to my academy student(s)?**

Letters and cards may be sent to our post office box:
