**Arranging a Visit to Our Campus**  
Prospective students have the opportunity to experience life at Ouachita Hills Academy 
during our annual Academy Days Weekend which is usually scheduled for the 
beginning of March each year. Students and their families stay with us on our campus and 
become part of our classes, vocational experience and worship times. They also join us for 
Friday evening service, church on Sabbath morning, Sabbath afternoon outreach and our 
Saturday night activity.

Visits are possible at other times of the year as well. Our guest rooms can be reserved 
and meals are available for purchase in our dining hall.

Please [contact us](/pages/contact.html) to make 
arrangements for your visit. We look forward to meeting you!
