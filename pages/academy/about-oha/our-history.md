**Our History**  
Ouachita Hills Academy opened its doors for the first time in the fall of 1988 on a
temporary site on the property of Dr. and Mrs. Chester Clark, Jr., in Amity, Arkansas.
Only grades 9 and 10 were taught the first year, with grade 11 being added the
second year and grade 12 the third. When the enrollment reached 26 in our fifth year, the
school had outgrown its facilities.

A permanent location was found for the supporting ministry school: 381 acres four miles
south of Amity. Building the campus was a slow process because of the decision to avoid a
large indebtedness in the building of facilities and because of a commitment to teach
male students basic construction skills. Today, the main campus facilities for the Academy
have been completed: two dorms, Administration/Classroom building, Cafeteria, Industrial
Arts building, Farm and Cabinet shops, greenhouse, and two hoop houses. Additional
construction projects continue to be available for student learning due to expansion of
Ouachita Hills College, which began sharing the campus in 2003.
