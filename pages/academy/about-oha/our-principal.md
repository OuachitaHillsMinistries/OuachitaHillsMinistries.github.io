**Welcome to Ouachita Hills Academy!**

Thank you for visiting our website! We hope you like what you see! If you are
looking for a Christian high school with high spiritual, academic, and social
standards; or if you are looking to find a ministry you can be a part of, either by
becoming a staff member or by providing financial support, you have come to a good
place.

Ouachita Hills Academy exists for the purpose of educating students for the present
world and for eternity. We do not only want our students to only be well prepared
for life on this earth but also to be diligently working for the Lord in soul saving until
He comes.

The school is located on 381 acres in the rolling hills and pine forests of south
central Arkansas. Many visitors comment about the park-like setting and the quietness and
peacefulness of the campus.

Our class offerings have been chosen with college readiness in mind but more
importantly, with a desire to teach students spiritual, academic, and vocational skills and
lessons which inspiration tells us they should learn while in school.College admissions test
scores are generally above the state and national average and students are readily accepted
into public and private colleges and universities,many receiving scholarships.

Our student body is culturally diverse, as are our instructors. Students, many of
whom have been home schooled for part or all of their academic lives, generally
come each year from 20+ states.

But donâ€™t take my word for us. Call and make an appointment to visit our campus,
and see what Ouachita Hills Academy is all about!

Blessings,

**Harriet Clark**  
*Principal*
