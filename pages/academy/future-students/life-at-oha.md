**Spiritual Growth**
  
There&#8217;s a lot more to life at OHA than academics and practical training. Everything 
we do here is truly centered on spiritual growth and a closer walk with Christ.

Every day begins and ends with prayer, worship and Bible study. The peacefulness and 
beauty of our rural campus makes an ideal setting for contemplating the deep meaning of 
Scripture and for spending one-on-one time with God.

Sabbath is the high point of every week, and we take time on Friday afternoons to prepare 
our hearts and minds. On Sabbath mornings OHA students attend church together, where they 
may be involved in teaching a lesson, talking about world missions, or leading praise and 
worship through music. Sabbath afternoons are a time for sharing with the community 
through outreach, or spending time together in the beautiful natural areas near our campus.

**Campus Life**
  
Every Saturday night we spend time together as a school. On some nights we learn something 
new like calligraphy or how to prepare cultural foods. We might watch a documentary, or 
maybe work on a project that helps missionaries working in other countries.

Throughout the week, dorm life is where students get to know each other beyond classes and 
academic life. Most students have one or two roommates, although some returning students 
have their own rooms. In the evenings students go to worship at their dorms and study 
together for their classes.

**Health and Fitness**
  
We care deeply about our students&#8217; health, and we work to provide the best possible 
food to give our students strong bodies and clear minds. Our school, through inspired 
counsel, has chosen to serve a vegan diet, and we also make gluten-free options available 
at every meal. Many of the fresh vegetables we serve come straight from our own farm. In 
addition to great food, we also have regular exercise times throughout the week where 
students experience the benefits of stretching, calisthenics and running or walking.
