**Transcript Requests**

Ouachita Hills College issues transcripts of a student's academic records upon receiving a 
**written request**\* from the student or the school the student wishes to attend. 
The first transcript is issued without cost, and there is a $5.00 fee for each additional 
transcript. Transcripts are not issued for students with unpaid accounts.

Please feel free to contact the registrar if you have any questions or concerns.
