We thank God for each and every one of you who faithfully support our school with your 
prayers, labor, and finances. It is because of the generosity of many of you that we have 
been able to work on special projects that are critical to our school, and which could not 
be funded from our operational budget.

In the &#8220;Designation&#8221; drop-down menu you&#8217;ll find some of our present needs. 
We encourage you to prayerfully consider partnering with us in these endeavors.

Thank you so much for helping us to improve our school and continue God&#8217;s work!
