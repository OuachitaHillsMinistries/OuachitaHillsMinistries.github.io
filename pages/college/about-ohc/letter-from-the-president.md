**Welcome to Ouachita Hills College!**  
I invite you to explore our website and get acquainted with who we are. Find out what makes 
Ouachita Hills College unique. Discover that since its beginnings, OHC leadership has been 
committed to following God’s counsel in education.

Our focus is to provide a well-rounded education where our students have opportunities to 
develop their mental, physical and spiritual powers. Here, away from many distractions, 
students can make it a priority to strengthen their relationship with God and deepen their 
knowledge of Scripture while they acquire skills that equip them for a life of service.

An education like this has a price. At a time when the cost of higher education has reached 
a record high, Ouachita Hills College follows an operation model that allows us to keep 
expenses down, making education affordable for our students. This model also opens 
opportunities for students to have a real-life work experience that enhances their 
academic and physical growth.

Students describe Ouachita Hills College as a family where eternal friendships are formed. 
But do not take their word for it. I invite you to come and experience OHC at its best – 
where staff and students study, work, socialize, and worship together in an environment 
where Christ is uplifted in all that we do.

I hope to see you soon!

 
Sincerely,

**Magda Rodriguez**
President, Ouachita Hills College
