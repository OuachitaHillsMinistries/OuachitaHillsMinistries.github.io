**Accreditation Statement**

Ouachita Hills College has chosen not to seek the endorsement of any accrediting body. 
However, the school has established an articulation agreement with Andrews University by 
which many of our classes transfer to Andrews University if the student desires to earn an 
accredited degree. We are in the process of establishing an articulation agreement with Southwestern Adventist University Education Department. 

**State Certification**

Ouachita Hills College has received a Letter of Exemption from Certification issued by the 
Arkansas Department of Higher Education to offer non-academic or church-related courses and 
grant non-academic awards or church-related degrees.
