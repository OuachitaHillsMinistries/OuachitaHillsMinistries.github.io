Ouachita Hills Ministries is a fast growing, Seventh-day Adventist self-supporting institution
that operates in accordance with the fundamental beliefs and practices of the Seventh-day
Adventist Church. Ouachita Ministries, Inc. is member of Adventist-Laymen Services and
Industries organization (ASI) and is recognized by the Arkansas-Louisiana Conference of
Seventh-day Adventists as an integral part of the ministry and mission of the Arkansas-Louisiana
Conference.

Ouachita Hills Ministries was founded in 1988 and is located on four hundred and twenty-one
acres of land towards North West of Amity, Arkansas, where the mild, invigorating climate,
with moderately cool nights, is not only conducive to study, but also provides an environment
for healthy living.

Ouachita Hills College is one of two Ouachita Hills Ministries’ organizations whose mission
is to provide a Christ-centered, character-oriented education, which equips students to be
successful in their chosen profession and to be active soul winners for God. As a religious
organization, we are looking for Seventh-day Adventist employees who understand and are
committed to the SDA mission and its counsel on Christian education.

We encourage you to push your skills to the limit as you tackle the challenge of awakening
young minds to the reality of their worth in Christ. Connect with students who are eager
to serve God. Thrive in an environment where true education isn’t just talked about, it’s
lived.
