#### Fall Mission Trip

At Ouachita Hills College, we believe every student can be a missionary for life no matter where
God calls them to live and work. Each fall OHC students have a unique opportunity to bring the
hope of salvation to unreached people around the world.

College students team up with students from Ouachita Hills Academy to organize evangelistic 
series and children's meetings, present health talks, give Bible studies and sometimes aid 
in construction projects. The trip is scheduled at the end of the college fall semester and 
extends over the Thanksgiving break.

The individual funding needed to participate in this trip is approximately $1600.Students 
are responsible for fundraising, and may consider working with their families and home 
church congregations.

#### Student-organized Mission Trips

Some OHC students may plan and organize mission trips during Spring Break or summer vacation. 
Students are welcome to participate in these mission trips, and are responsible for fundraising.
