##### Welcome to the Department of Health and Life Sciences!

Our focus is to engage students in learning about the complex systems and relationships we
observe in living organisms and the natural world. Our hope is that each student will develop
a deeper relationship with our Creator as they study and prepare for their life's work.

An essential element of any discipline is the ability to ask meaningful questions and to
devise strategies for addressing those questions; thus, investigative thinking is a central
theme of our courses. Our students develop investigative strategies through problem solving,
data analysis and experimental design.

We are committed to a practical approach for studying the human body and health. Our courses
emphasize human disease and its causes, as well as natural, effective methods to prevent and
treat disease. Students are challenged to examine the connections between nutrition, lifestyle
and overall health, and to develop models for educating individuals, families and communities
about health.
