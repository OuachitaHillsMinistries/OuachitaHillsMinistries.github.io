      <strong>Welcome to the Department of Health and Life Sciences!</strong></p> 
      
      <p>
        Our focus is to engage students in learning about the complex systems and relationships we observe in living organisms and the natural world. Our hope is that each student will develop a deeper relationship with our Creator as they study and prepare for their life's work.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        An essential element of any discipline is the ability to ask meaningful questions and to devise strategies for addressing those questions; thus, investigative thinking is a central theme of our courses. Our students develop investigative strategies through problem solving, data analysis and experimental design.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We are committed to a practical approach for studying the human body and health. Our courses emphasize human disease and its causes, as well as natural, effective methods to prevent and treat disease. Students are challenged to examine the connections between nutrition, lifestyle and overall health, and to develop models for educating individuals, families and communities about health.<br /> </div> 
        
        <div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
          We currently offer an emphasis in life science or health, and degree programs are being developed. We are able to offer the first two years of general studies with an emphasis in the sciences, which can be transferred to another institute in order to continue in pre-medicine, nursing or allied health programs. </p> 
          
          <p>
            Our affiliation with Andrews University gives students the opportunity to earn an Associate's degree at Ouachita Hills College and to transfer directly to an Andrews University program.<br /> </div>

                We seek to engage students in the study of living systems and the natural world that they might see the hand of the Creator in all.

              <p>
                We endeavor to give students an understanding of key life science concepts that will complement study in scientific disciplines and strengthen analytical skills required for all fields of study.

              <p>
                We also strive to foster innovative thinking by asking students to consider current challenges and new applications for biological sciences.<br /> </div></div></div>
