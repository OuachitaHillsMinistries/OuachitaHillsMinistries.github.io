### Welcome to the Department of Business at Ouachita Hills College!

We are in the business of equipping students for service as they grow academically and spiritually at Ouachita Hills.

The Christian Business Management Program gives students the opportunity to gain a broad set of 
skills in administration and leadership. There is a strong emphasis on Christian business principles that 
prepares them to be witnesses for Christ in the work place.

We are proud of a student-friendly culture marked by responsiveness and flexibility. The Business Department faculty is 
made up of committed Christian professionals with significant outside-the-classroom service experience as administrators, leaders,  consultants and business researchers. We are committed to providing students with educational experiences that challenge them to make 
a tangible difference in the lives of others, that stimulates their minds and hearts, enlarge their imaginations, and help them to 
build lasting friendships. By organizing social entrepreneurial ventures, helping people in need, and conducting 
community education programs, our students can develop empathy and deepen their understanding of the real-world 
significance of their studies.


We promise our students an extraordinary preparation for responsible servant- leadership in business and service organization. 

Come and expereince our Business Department!
