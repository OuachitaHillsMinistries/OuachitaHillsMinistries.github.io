### Welcome to the Department of Business at Ouachita Hills College!

We at the department are in the business of transferring, and revitalizing teaching, scholarship and service. Our goal 
is to help students to create Christian values so that they can make a difference.

The Christian Business Management Program that we presently offer gives students the opportunity to gain a broad set of 
skills in business administration and leadership. There is a strong emphasis on Christian business principles that 
prepares them to be witnesses for Christ in the work place.

We are proud of a student-friendly culture marked by responsiveness and flexibility. The Business Department faculty is 
made up of capable professionals with significant outside-the-classroom experience as consultants and researchers. The 
entire Business Department is committed to providing students with educational experiences that challenge them to make 
a tangible difference in the world, that stimulates their minds and hearts, enlarge their imaginations, and help them to 
build lasting friendships. By organizing social entrepreneurial ventures, helping people in need, and conducting 
community education programs, our students can develop empathy and deepen their understanding of the real-world 
significance of their studies.

We promise our students an extraordinary preparation for responsible servant- leadership in business, government, and 
the nonprofit sector. We hope you’ll join us.
