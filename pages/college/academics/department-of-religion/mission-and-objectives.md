The Religion Department of Ouachita Hills College exists to assist every student in developing 
a well-rounded, functional, and personal relationship with the Creator God as revealed in Scripture 
and the Spirit of Prophecy, and to equip them to take up their individually specific roles in the 
mission of His church to the world. 

In pursuit of these overall objectives, the department seeks to achieve each of the following 
four core goals.

**Spiritual Growth**  
Lead each student to a more personal, dynamic, and saving relationship with the Creator God of 
Heaven, and to a personal commitment to participate in His mission.

**Academic Knowledge**  
Equip each student with a solid functional understanding of both 
Scripture and the Spirit of Prophecy counsels provided by God through Ellen G. White, 
while at the same time equipping them with the understanding of other current, relevant, 
supporting, and contrasting information which serves to provide a further and deeper 
understanding of these counsels.

**Contextual Knowledge**  
Provide each student with a clear and complete working understanding of Christ's church, 
its mission in history, as well as its current condition and mission today. Also to provide 
each student with an understanding of how he or she, as an individual, can fit into the role 
and mission of His church.

**Functional Preparedness**  
Prepare students for their unique contribution to the world-wide mission of the church by 
assisting them in assessing and developing their personal aptitudes, skills, and abilities 
through the use of traditional style didactic learning methods, as well as the provision of 
numerous opportunities to practice and develop these skills.
