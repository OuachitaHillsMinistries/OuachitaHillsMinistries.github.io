**Welcome to the Department of Religion at Ouachita Hills College!**

We seek to equip students with a solid functional understanding of both Scripture and the 
Spirit of Prophecy counsels and to promote understanding of relevant supporting and contrasting 
information. Students will develop a clear understanding of Godâ€™s end-time church and its 
mission.

The Religion Department offers a four-year training program for both theology and biblical 
studies majors, with each student experiencing a 12-week ministerial practicum during their 
last year before graduation. The program offers classes that give our students a good foundation 
for varied ministry opportunities.  It helps the student understand current issues facing our 
church & mission and gain practical experience in various types of personal and public ministry.  
We also offer a two-year personal evangelism training program especially focusing on Bible work 
and literature evangelism.  We are seeking to make our classes is practical, substantive, and 
thorough. 

Our Theology, Biblical Studies and Personal Evangelism graduates have done much with their 
training. Here in North America our graduates are serving as pastors, evangelists and canvassing 
leaders.  Other graduates have gone to foreign mission fields and are using the skills they 
learned here at OHC to enlarge the kingdom of heaven around the world. Still others are active 
leaders in their local Adventist churches doing their part to hasten the second coming of 
Jesus.

If you want to grow spiritually, learn diligently and prepare earnestly, we would love to 
have you come join us as we learn of Jesus and His methods to teach and reach our world for 
Him!

Sincerely,

**Pastor Kevin Powell**
