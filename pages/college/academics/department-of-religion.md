The Religion Department seeks to equip students with a solid understanding of both 
Scripture and the Spirit of Prophecy counsels provided by God through Ellen G. White, 
and to promote understanding of relevant supporting and contrasting information. Students 
will develop a clear and complete understanding of Christâ€™s church and its mission in 
history, and gain perspective on its current condition and mission today.
