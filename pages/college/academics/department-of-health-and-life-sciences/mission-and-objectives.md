We seek to engage students in the study of living systems and the natural world that they 
might see the hand of the Creator in all.

We endeavor to give students an understanding of key life science concepts that will 
complement study in scientific disciplines and strengthen analytical skills required for 
all fields of study.

We also strive to foster innovative thinking by asking students to consider current challenges 
and new applications for biological sciences.
