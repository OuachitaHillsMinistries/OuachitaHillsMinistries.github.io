We currently offer an emphasis in life science or health, and degree programs are being 
developed. We are able to offer the first two years of general studies with an emphasis 
in the sciences, which can be transferred to another institute in order to continue in 
pre-medicine, nursing or allied health programs.

Our affiliation with Andrews University gives students the opportunity to earn an Associate's 
degree at Ouachita Hills College and to transfer directly to an Andrews University program.
