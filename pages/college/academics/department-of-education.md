**Welcome to the Department of Education!** 
      
The Education Department at OHC offers a four-year training program for both elementary 
and secondary education majors, with each student experiencing a student-teaching opportunity 
during their last semester before graduation. The program offers some classes that are specific 
to an elementary classroom, some that are specific to a secondary classroom, and other classes 
that cover information vital to both types of classrooms. The training our students receive in 
the education classes is eminently practical, interactive, and thorough.
      
Just a few of the things our education majors become well-versed in include: the 4MAT 
teaching model (with the most recent brain-research findings), cooperative learning methods, 
designing lesson units and plans, and how to teach without books (for those planning on 
going to the foreign mission field).

Our elementary and secondary education graduates have done much with their training. Many 
are teaching in Adventist schools around the country. Others have had the opportunity to 
help small churches start a church school and have seen those schools flourish and minister 
to many in the churches and surrounding communities. Still other graduates have gone to the 
foreign mission fields and are using the skills they learned here at OHC to enlarge the 
kingdom of heaven.

We would love to have you come join us as we learn the best methods to teach and reach young 
souls for Jesus!
      
Sincerely,
      
**MaryAnn Walden, Department Chair**
