### Scholarships

_Canvassing Scholarship Program_

Students participating in the Canvassing Scholarship Program will participate in OHC’s canvassing
programs for 10-weeks per year. In return their canvassing scholarships from the programs
operated during the summer and winter breaks will be matched dollar for dollar up to $1,000
per semester, provided payment of those earnings is made directly to OHC. Students will receive
money for living expenses, tithe, and offerings from the scholarship funds paid to OHC. The 10
weeks of canvassing in OHC’s programs do not otherwise affect the account of the student. No
scholarship is received from these ten weeks except the matching funds mentioned above.

Please contact our registrar's office at 870-342-6210 ext 227 for more details.

_Bible Work Scholarship Program_

In order to be eligible for the Bible-Work Scholarship Program, the following requirements
must be met:

The students must work in an OHC-approved Bible-work position during the summer (10 weeks)
and winter (3 weeks) breaks. Payment of all earnings from the OHC-approved Bible-work position
must be paid directly to OHC. The student must have been enrolled at OHC for at least one
year prior to applying for this scholarship.

If the student is found to be eligible of the Bible-Work Scholarship Program, their earnings
will be matched dollar for dollar up to $1,000 per semester. The student will receive money
for food, tithe, and offerings form the scholarship funds paid to OHC.

_Recruitment Scholarship Program_

OHC will credit a student’s account $500 for every additional student recruited who completes
two semesters.

_Other Matching Scholarships_

For non-literature evangelism ministries, OHC will match 25% of approved program scholarships
(maximum of $500 in matching funds). This will be applied over two semesters and on the conditions
that the student 1) releases the earnings being matched to OHC and 2) takes part in the OHC
canvassing program during the school year.

### Student Financial Responsibility

OHC will assist students in their financial planning. However, responsibility for payment
of college expenses rest with the student, regardless of any assistance which may be expected
or reviewed from parents, OHC, or other sources.

Before registering, each student must submit a Payment Contract to the Student Finance Office
signed by the student indicating acknowledgment of this responsibility. Student financial
responsibility includes awareness of information on student costs and means of paying those
costs.
