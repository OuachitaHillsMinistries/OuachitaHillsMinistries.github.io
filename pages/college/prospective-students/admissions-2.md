**Admission Process**

Ouachita Hills College admits students of any disability, race or color, national or 
ethnic origin to all rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or 
made available to students at the school. No discrimination in the administration of 
educational policies, scholarships, vocational training, extracurricular activities, or 
other school-administered programs is allowed.

Due to current U.S. Immigration regulations, OHC is unable to issue I-20’s for foreign 
students at this time.

**General Admission Requirements**
  
We are seeking students who desire to be committed disciples of Jesus Christ.

Prospective students must have graduated from a secondary school, possess an equivalent 
diploma, or have successfully completed the US General Education Development (GED) exam 
(minimum total score 225, no score below 40 on any of the five tests).

The minimum acceptable secondary school grade point average must be 2.15 or higher on the 
standard 4.0 scale. We also require a minimum composite score of 18 on the Enhanced 
American College Test (ACT) or a minimum of 400 on each individual score on the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test (SAT).

All students are expected to uphold the policies and standards of Ouachita Hills College 
as a Seventh-day Adventist institution. OHC reserves the right to deny admission based on 
its inability to meet the student’s educational needs and objectives.

**Admission of Transfer Students**
  
Students transferring from other recognized colleges or universities must have a combined 
cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or better. Students transferring to OHC with fewer 
than 24 semester credits (or 36 quarter credits) will be considered for admission on the 
basis of a combination of scores from their secondary school records and previous college 
work.
